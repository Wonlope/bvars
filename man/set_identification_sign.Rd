\description{
set identification via sign restrictions
}
\details{
This functions creates an object of the class sign needed for the identification of structural shocks. Identification of structural shocks is needed for further analytic steps such as studying Impulse-Responses or Historical Decomposition. Necessary input is a KxK-matrix with the sign restrictions, i.e. a positive or negative number. And K is the number of variables in the VAR-model. Sign-Restriction is implemented using the Algorithm proposed by Rubio-Ramirez et al. (2010).
