\description{
Identify structural shocks using zero restrictions
}
\details{
This function creates an object of the class zero needed for identification of structural shocks. Identification of structural shocks is needed for further analytic steps such as studying Impulse-Responses or Historical Decomposition. Necessary input is a KxKxK-matrix with zero restrictions, i.e. a 3-dimensional matrix of 0s and 1s with K being the number of variables in the VAR-model. Zero-restriction is implemented using the algorithm proposed by
