\description{
Function to estimate factor-augmented vector autoregressions using a 2-step procedure.
}
\details{
Estimates a favar-model using a 2-step procedure. In the first step the factors are extracted from the series using principal components. In the second step, a VAR-model of order p of both the factor series and other variables is estimated. To uniquely identify the favar all series are normalized with mean 0 and standard deviation of 1. Furthermore, the variance-covariance matrix is assumed to be diagonal. The VAR-model is of the form
\deqn{\left[\begin{array}{c}Y_t\\ F_t\end{array}\right]=\Phi(L)\left[\begin{array}{c}Y_{t-1}\\ F_{t-1}\end{array}\right]+w_t}
and the observation equation takes the form
\deqn{X_t=\Lambda^fF_t+\Lambda^yY_t+e_t}
Since a model with \eqn{\tilde{\Lambda}^f=\Lambda^fH} and \eqn{\tilde{F}_t=H^{-1}F_t} are observationally equivalent to eqn{\Lambda,F} we impose the standard normalization restriction implicit in the principal components. One interpretation of the factors is that they are a diffusion index as in Stock and Watson (1998)
