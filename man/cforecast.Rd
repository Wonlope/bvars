\description{
Conditional forecasts
}
\details{
Conditional forecasts are forecasts conditional on given values for a subset of variables and are obtained by pre-determining the path of certain variables. Waggoner and Zha (1999) show that the distribution of future shocks is normal with
\deqn{\eta\sim N(\bar{\eta},\bar\Gamma)}
where
\deqn{\bar{\eta}=R'(RR')^{-1}r}
and
\deqn{\Gamma=I-R'(RR')^{-1}R}
with \eqn{\eta} the \eqn{s\times1}-vector of structural shocks and \eqn{r} is the vector of differences between predicted and conditional values.
Instead of drawing directly from the above distribution we use a singular value decomposition of \eqn{R} as proposed by
